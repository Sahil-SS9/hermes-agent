"""Board identity compatibility layer for operational cron scripts.

The KENSEI board registry was reorganised: three legacy board slugs were
retired in favour of canonical successors:

    legacy ``default``     → canonical ``core``        (DB moved from
                             ``<root>/kanban.db`` to
                             ``<root>/kanban/boards/core/kanban.db``)
    legacy ``ops``         → canonical ``security-ops``
    legacy ``content-lead``→ canonical ``content``

The seven operational scripts covered by W1 Batch 1 hardcode the legacy
slugs (and their DB paths).  This module lets those scripts resolve a
legacy slug to the *current* DB path **reversibly**: if the legacy board's
DB still exists on disk the legacy path is returned (migration has not
happened yet on that host); otherwise the canonical successor's path is
resolved via :func:`hermes_cli.kanban_db.kanban_db_path`.

Constraints honoured (from the controller-verified scope):

* Reuses the existing canonical board resolution — no parallel registry.
* Does **not** replace semantic domain labels/keywords.  Routing-key maps
  and human text keep their original slugs; only the DB *path identity*
  is resolved through this layer.
* Reversible: works whether or not the migration has happened on the host.
