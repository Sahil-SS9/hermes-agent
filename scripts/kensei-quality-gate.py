KENSEI Quality Gate - picks up tasks in 'review' status and routes through Multi-Gate QA.
Runs as no_agent: true cron at 09:00, 13:00, 17:00, 21:00.

NOTE: As of 04/06/26 the canonical review path is the sdlc-review skill loaded
by the kanban dispatcher (kanban_db.py:7152). This script is retained as a
backstop that feeds findings into the review column; its gate-creation logic
will be folded into the review column in a future pass (Audit M5 roadmap).
