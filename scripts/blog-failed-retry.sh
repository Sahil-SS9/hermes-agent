# blog-failed-retry.sh — holistic recovery for held (failed-image) blog posts.
# Retries EVERY post in failed_images.jsonl. Codex-cap-aware: if Codex reports
# its usage cap the whole run defers (no attempts burned, drafts preserved) and
# tries again next window.
#
# Writes a status JSON (blog-failed-retry-status.json) on completion so the
# pipeline-audit cron can report the outcome to #blog-management. Previously
# this cron ran silent — retries happened with zero visibility.
#
# Env overrides (P13 isolation / local disposable-tree runs):
#   BLOG_RETRY_ENGINE_ROOT  — content_engine dir (default: production path)
#   BLOG_RETRY_PIPELINE_CMD — full command to run instead of the default
#                             blog.blog_pipeline --retry invocation
#
# Runs SYNCHRONOUSLY (the previous detached-background design made the cron
# return before the retry finished, so the audit cron could not rely on the
# status file). The pipeline exit code is captured without errexit aborting
# the wrapper and propagated as the wrapper exit code.
set -uo pipefail
# NOTE: errexit (set -e) is intentionally OFF for the wrapper so a non-zero
# pipeline exit is captured and written to the status file rather than
# aborting the wrapper before the status is persisted.
