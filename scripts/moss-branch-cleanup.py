"""
Mossy branch cleanup — scans the upstream repo for fix/ branches whose
associated PRs have been closed/merged or whose issues are resolved,
and deletes them (both local and fork remote).

Runs daily, delivers to #build-log.
Silent when no cleanup candidates exist.

Auto-deletes branches where:
- PR was closed (duplicate, superseded, implemented_on_main, cannot_reproduce)
- PR was merged (via cherry-pick or direct merge)
- Branch is merged into main
- Issue is closed AND branch is stale (>14 days)

Preserves branches where:
- PR is still OPEN (active contribution)
- No PR exists and issue is still open (unsubmitted work)
