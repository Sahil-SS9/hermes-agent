## How messages flow through the stack

```
Message arrives in Discord
  → Gateway adapter checks message.author.bot
    → If bot: check DISCORD_ALLOW_BOTS
      → "none": silent drop
      → "mentions": only proceed if @mentioned
      → "all": always proceed
  → Multi-agent filter: if other bots @mentioned but not us, drop
  → Check free_response_channels (channel whitelist for no-mention)
    → If channel IS in free_response_channels: always process
    → If channel IS NOT: require @mention
      → Has @mention: process + backfill history (up to 50 messages)
      → No @mention: silent drop
  → Event assembled: text + channel_context + channel_prompt + skills
  → Session created (new or continued)
  → Agent processes, generates response
  → Response posted to channel
```

## Gateway lifecycle notification routing

`gateway_restart_notification` is per-profile in the `discord:` section's `extra:` block:

| Profile | Flag | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Kensei-root | `true` | Restart notifications sent to Kensei's home channel (`#general`, ID 1506021205797507265) |
| All 8 specialists | `false` | Silent — no notifications anywhere |

This means shutdown/restart messages only appear in `#general`. No flood in domain channels. The flag has no per-channel routing option (it's all-or-nothing), so the split approach achieves single-channel notifications by giving Kensei the only `true` flag.

## Key principle: free_response is for domain channels, not for general chat

- A bot's HOME CHANNEL is where it should be free-response (e.g. `#design-review` for Dezzy)
- CO-WORKING channels (e.g. `#war-room`, `#research-ops`) have multiple bots that may be free-response or @mention-only
- GENERAL channels (`#general`, `#cron-outputs`) should be Kensei-only for free-response
- All other channels: require @mention to reduce unwanted chime-in

## History: how we got here

1. **2026-05-22**: 8-gateway deployment. Specialist configs created without `discord:` sections.
2. **2026-05-24 01:00**: Dezzy silent-drop discovered. `discord:` section added with `free_response_channels: #design-review`.
3. **2026-05-24 01:20**: Remaining 7 specialists also missing `discord:` sections. Added `free_response_channels` per domain.
4. **2026-05-24 01:30**: Duplicate `discord:` sections found on 6 profiles (old empty + new populated). Cleaned up.
5. **2026-05-24 01:40**: Root Kensei config had `#ai-learning-qa` as free_response with MrHermagi prompt — hijacked from Miyagi. Migrated to Miyagi's profile.
6. **2026-05-24 01:45**: `allow_bots: mentions` added to all 9 profiles for explicit bot-to-bot handoff with @mention.
