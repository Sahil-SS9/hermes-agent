"""Regression test for the ambient-toolset mechanism.

Pins the producer/consumer availability symmetry whose violation caused the
Toolaria rescue bug: a tool registered under an *ambient* toolset must be
reachable in a session whose ``enabled_toolsets`` does NOT name that toolset.

Without this guarantee a plugin whose result-transform hook fires ungated
(Toolaria rescues oversized results in every session) can replace a large
result with a handle the model can never fetch, because the retrieval tool is
filtered out of restricted (cron/profile) sessions. The fix mirrors the
kanban-lifecycle exemption: ambient toolsets are unioned into every session's
tool set and allow-set, and are never deferred behind tool_search.

A non-ambient probe tool is the negative control: it must stay scoped out, so
the test proves the union is targeted, not a blanket "include everything".
