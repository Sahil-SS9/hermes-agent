"""Discord adapter ↔ MisaMisaVoiceBridge integration seam tests.

Phase 2a AC #1: one approved integration seam connects live Misa-Misa
Discord voice I/O to ``kensei-voice`` without duplicate receive/STT/
playback ownership.

These tests pin the contract between the Discord adapter
(``plugins/platforms/discord/adapter.py``) and the bridge
(``kensei_voice.misa_misa_seam``) so the seam cannot regress to
"two STT pipelines on one Discord client" or "legacy VoiceReceiver
running in parallel with the bridge".

A fake :class:`VoiceRecvClient` stands in for the live Discord
voice client; the real ``MisaMisaVoiceBridge`` runs against it.
