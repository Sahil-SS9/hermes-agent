"""LLM Council — multi-model deliberation gate on PRD+Spec.

Three-phase deliberation adapted from Karpathy's llm-council pattern:

Phase 1 — Independent review (parallel):
    Each panel model reviews PRD+Spec alone and returns a structured
    critique: completeness, technical feasibility, risks, scope creep,
    missing AC, simpler alternatives. Vote: APPROVED or REVISE.

Phase 2 — Cross-ranking (anonymised):
    Each model sees the others' critiques as Reviewer A/B/C (authorship
    hidden), marks agreements vs disagreements, ranks them.

Phase 3 — Chairman synthesis:
    Chairman reads PRD+Spec + all critiques + rankings and emits one
    verdict: APPROVED or REVISE with a deduplicated, severity-ranked
    issue list.

Artifact: ``council-verdict.md`` written to the task's artifact directory.
