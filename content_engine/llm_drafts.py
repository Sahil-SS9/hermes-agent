It hasn't been for over a year.\n\nThe thing actually limiting AI features in production isn't capability — it's context. What information the model sees before it answers. What's persistent vs. what's transient. What's retrieved vs. what's hardcoded into the system prompt.\n\nDatadog's recent State of AI Engineering report put it cleanly: \"context quality, not volume, is the new limiting factor for LLM agents.\"\n\nI've watched this pattern repeatedly. A team picks a model, ships a feature, output quality is patchy, they assume the model is the problem, they switch models, output quality stays patchy.\n\nThe fix is almost always upstream of the model.\n\nMost of the gap between \"AI demo\" and \"AI feature in production\" is closed by treating context like infrastructure, not configuration.\n\n#ProductManagement #AIProductManagement #ContextEngineering #AIAdoption",

    "Three patterns I keep seeing in teams trying to ship AI features.\n\n1. They pick the model first. Not the data. The model. Like choosing wheels before building the car.\n2. They evaluate output quality with vibes. \"Looks good.\" \"Feels better than before.\" No eval framework. No benchmark.\n3. They don't instrument what they ship. \"Users love it\" is not a metric.\n\nI've been product for nearly 7 years. The best AI features I've shipped followed the opposite order:\n\nData first.

They answer every question. They hallucinate gracefully. They're impressive.\n\nProduction features can't do that. They need guardrails. They need to know when to say \"I don't know.\" They need to handle edge cases that the demo never considered.\n\nThe gap between demo and production is about 90% requirements engineering and 10% prompt tuning.\n\nMost teams spend it the other way around.\n\n#ProductManagement #AIProductManagement #AIAdoption",

The vulnerabilities aren't syntax errors — they're architectural choices the AI made that no static analyser is built to catch.\n\nI build apps as a solo developer and use AI heavily. This doesn't make me stop. It makes me more deliberate about three things:\n\n1. CI/CD that runs security scans before anything ships, not after.\n2.

Engineers build it, PMs scope it, and then it sits in the backlog because nobody's performance metric is 'make AI work.'\n\n2. The context gap. Teams treat AI output quality as a model problem. It's a data problem. The prompt, the retrieval pipeline, the guardrails, the feedback loop — these shape 80%+ of the output.\n\n3. The measurement problem. Teams ship AI features but don't instrument them. 'Users love it' isn't a metric. Conversion lift is.\n\nI've seen this pattern at three companies now.

The coaching point travels when the activity changes.\n3. Build sessions around principles, not players. If your key player is away, the session still works.\n\nCoachOS lets you build adaptable sessions and capture post-session notes so next week is better.\n\nSee you on Sunday.",

    "Wednesday night under floodlights. Cold. The training session you planned for 90 minutes needs to run in 60 because half the pitch is booked by the senior team.\n\nHere is the thing about coaching: if you have planned with progressions, you are fine. If you have planned fixed drills, you are stuck.\n\nCoachOS builds sessions in progressions by default. Every activity has an easier version and a harder version ready. When circumstances change, the session still works.\n\nLess admin. More coaching.",

    "Most coaches spend 45 minutes planning a 90-minute session.\n\nThen 90 minutes running it. Then zero minutes writing down what happened.\n\nSo next week, they are planning from memory.\n\n'I think the rondo worked' is not a good basis for a progressive session.\n\nCoachOS changes the last part. Post-session debrief takes two minutes. Voice note, hands still in gloves. Next week's plan starts from last week's notes.\n\nYour clipboard, upgraded.",

    "Building a session curriculum for the season is not glamorous.\n\nBut it is the difference between coaches who repeat the same six drills for 30 weeks and coaches whose players actually improve.\n\nBlock periodisation for grassroots:\n\nPre-season: fitness and first touch\nBlock 1: passing and possession\nBlock 2: defending as a unit\nBlock 3: transitions\n\nCoachOS lets you plan at the season level and drill down to the individual session. The whole curriculum, connected.\n\nBuilt for the coach on the sideline.",

Next week's plan auto-suggested from what worked.\n\nOne place. Connected.\n\nLess admin. More coaching.",

    "The clipboard at grassroots football is a symbol of a bigger problem.\n\nIt is not the clipboard itself. It is the problem of information being trapped in a single format with no way to share, search, or review it later.\n\nSession plans on paper. Attendance on WhatsApp. Player development in your head. Fixtures in a league email.\n\nCoachOS puts it all in one place. Not as separate apps bolted together. As a connected system where attendance feeds into development, development shapes sessions, and sessions build into a season curriculum.\n\nYour clipboard, upgraded.",

One tap. No individual messages needed. No group chat drama.\n\nPlan. Track. Share. Improve.",

    "Three seasons into grassroots, you have developed a system.\n\nSort the bibs by colour. Check the ball bag count. Lay out cones in the boot so the warm-up set is on top.\n\nThe experienced part is the instinct. The admin part is still a mess.\n\nCoachOS is for the coach who knows football but dreads the paperwork. Session planning, attendance tracking, player notes -- all automated, all connected.\n\nBuilt for the coach on the sideline.",

    "A coach's kit bag says everything:\n\nCones (some broken). Bibs (mismatched). A battered clipboard with three seasons of session plans in a plastic folder.\n\nThe clipboard has your history. Three years of drills, formations, warm-up routines. All handwritten. All impossible to search.\n\nCoachOS digitises the whole thing without losing the coaching instinct that made you good.\n\nPlan. Track. Improve. Your clipboard, upgraded.",

Can you show it to the player?\n\nCoachOS tracks individual development across the season. Session notes. Attendance. Progress markers. When a parent asks, you have the evidence.\n\nPlan. Track. Improve.",

    "The difference between coaching a session and managing a session:\n\nCoaching: actively teaching. Correcting technique. Building habits.\nManaging: just keeping them occupied for 90 minutes.\n\nMost grassroots coaches manage because they lack the tools. No session plans with clear learning objectives. No individual player development goals. No way to review what worked.\n\nCoachOS gives you all three. Structured plans. Individual tracking. Post-session review.\n\nLess managing, more coaching.",

    "Player development is slow. Invisible day by day. Obvious month by month.\n\nThe player who could not take a touch under pressure in September is doing it confidently by November. But did you notice? Can you prove it to their parent?\n\nCoachOS builds a development timeline for every player. Session notes. Attendance. Progress markers. Individual goals set and tracked.\n\nYour coaching instinct captures the moment. CoachOS captures the evidence.",

    "Age-appropriate coaching is where most coaches get it wrong.\n\nUnder 8s do not need 11-a-side tactics. They need ball mastery, spatial awareness, and fun. The session that works for a 15 year old will destroy a 7 year old's confidence.\n\nCoachOS organises session plans by age group and development stage. U7s are different from U12s, which are different from U16s. Not harder versions of the same thing. Fundamentally different approaches.\n\nPlan. Track. Improve.",

    "The hardest player development conversation is with the kid who thinks they are not good enough.\n\nThey train. They show up. But they do not see their own progress because they are comparing to the best player, not to the player they were three months ago.\n\nCoachOS tracks individual progress against individual baselines. Not the group. Their own starting point.\n\n'You could not take a touch under pressure in September. Now you can. Here is the evidence.'\n\nThat changes a kid's season.",

    "Session planning for player development is not about drills. It is about progressions.\n\nWeek 1: Introduction. Simple drill. Low complexity.\nWeek 2: Same concept, more pressure. Add defenders.\nWeek 3: Game situation. Apply the concept in a match context.\nWeek 4: Review. What worked? What needs reinforcement?\n\nCoachOS structures sessions as progressions, not one-offs. Each session builds on the last. Each review improves the next.\n\nPlayer development is not a lucky dip. It is a system.\n\nSee you on Sunday.",

    "Most grassroots clubs measure success by league position.\n\nBut league position hides everything:\n\nThe player who went from last picked to regular starter.\nThe team that went from panic to structure.\nThe coach who stopped shouting and started asking questions.\n\nCoachOS tracks the metrics that actually matter: attendance consistency, individual progress, session quality. Not just the score.\n\nBecause development wins in the long run. League tables lie in the short term.",
