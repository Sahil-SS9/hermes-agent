# SahilBlog Content & Image Pipeline — Progress Tracker

**Last updated:** 30/06/26
**Owner:** KENSEI
**Execution mode:** Sequential, block-by-block. Zero technical debt. No incremental week-by-week changes — each block delivers a finished, tested, merged capability before the next starts.

---

## Execution Rules

1. **Sequential block execution.** Block N+1 does not start until Block N is fully merged, all tests pass (304 existing + new), and `pnpm build` passes in the SahilBlog repo.
2. **Zero technical debt.** Every changed file must have its test file updated. Every new module must have >=80% coverage (unit + integration). No `TODO`, `FIXME`, or `HACK` comments on merge. No dead code paths. No deprecated imports imported in new code.
3. **No incremental week-by-week changes.** Each block is a complete, self-contained capability. A block is "done" when the feature works end-to-end, is tested, merged, and the downstream consumer (pipeline cron, publisher, assembler) is wired correctly. There is no "we'll fix that in week 3" — it ships now or it waits for the next block.
4. **One pre-merge gate per block.** Before merging any block: full test suite passes, `pnpm build` passes, no FAL imports in blog path, no budget calls in blog image path, lint clean.
5. **Block atomicity.** If a block has sub-items (e.g. "Wire into write_with_gate"), all sub-items must ship together. No partial merges.

## Notes — Deviations from Original Plan

| Date | Deviation | Reason | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | **Section 2B deleted** (Monday morning action) | User constraint: no Magnus/Groktopus structure copying. Keep "What to try next". | Plan simplified by 1 block. All 38 posts already have actionable closes. |
| — | **Blocks reordered** — Codex CLI image generation moved to Block 2 | User constraint: Codex CLI exclusively, no FAL. This is a foundational dependency for all image-related work. | All subsequent image blocks (Gemini QA, OCR check) depend on Codex integration being in place first. |
| — | **Budget gating removed from blog image path** | Codex CLI uses ChatGPT auth (zero marginal cost per image). Budget cap is irrelevant. | Config variables `BLOG_IMAGE_COST_GBP` and `BACKFILL_SPEND_CAP_GBP` become unused for blog images. Left in config for backward compatibility but commented. |
| — | **No auto-regen on OCR failure** | Codex CLI is ~80s/image vs FAL's ~5s. Automatic regen on every OCR failure would stall the pipeline. | OCR failures are logged and batch-flagged. Manual review path instead of automatic regen. |
| — | **FAL `fal_client.py`, `imagery_transplant.py`, `postprocess.py` left untouched** | These modules serve the social content pipeline (Stage 2 in `content_engine.py`), which still uses FAL for Plenishd/CoachOS/MatchdayMaestro images. | Only the blog image path (`blog_illustrator.py`, `blog_pipeline.py`) removes FAL. The shared modules are not deleted, just unused from the blog side. |
| — | **No `post-publication feedback loop` as standalone block** | Integrated into Block 8 (retry threshold) as quality_score storage. | The router feedback loop is too small for its own block. Merged into the QC hardening block. |

**Notes on dependencies:**
- Block 1 has no upstream dependencies (can start immediately)
- Block 2 (Codex CLI) must complete before Blocks 3, 9, 10 (all image-related)
- Block 3 (failed-image handling) depends on Codex being in place to define what "failing" means
- Blocks 4-5 (grounding + company cases) are independent of Blocks 2-3 and could theoretically run in parallel, but sequential execution is enforced
- Block 6 (blueprints) depends on Codex for Mermaid diagram generation, and on Block 4 for source grounding in blueprint posts
- Block 7 (frameworks) depends on Block 6 (blueprint format is the output format)
- Block 8 (QC) is independent — could slot in anywhere, but placed after the main feature blocks (4-7) so the quality_score covers real posts
- Blocks 9-10 (image QA) depend on Codex (Block 2) being in place
- Block 11 (audit cron) is independent — can run anytime, scheduled last as housekeeping
- Block 12 (format normalisation) is independent — saved for last to avoid touching files that might be modified by earlier blocks
