"""Art director — one rich art brief per article, shared across hero + sections.

The blog image path is Codex CLI only. This module owns the creative layer
before Codex sees a prompt:

  - choose one visual mode for the whole post
  - apply creative-concept-direction: layered scene, tension, medium-as-concept
  - expose Baoyu-derived layout/workflow modes as Codex-compatible prompt modes
  - allow text/labels ONLY for styles designed for graphical information design
  - compile each image into a vivid prompt, not a long checklist

The illustrator fills each compiled prompt into Codex. Palette, layout grammar,
and motif are shared so the post reads as one designed set; hero and section
concepts differ so the images are not repetitive.
