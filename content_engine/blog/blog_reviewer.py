"""Editorial review layer for blog drafts.

A second-opinion LLM call, independent from the writer model, that scores a
draft against a strict rubric and returns claims to verify. Uses a free LLM
chain (not the longform writer chain) so the reviewer is always a different
voice from the writer.

Rubric (0-10 each, 10 = best):
  - accuracy_risk: are stated facts/numbers grounded or fabricated?
  - voice_fidelity: does the copy match the stream voice?
  - secret_sauce_leakage: (Builder) does it expose proprietary internals?
  - hype_honesty: is the hype-vs-reality honest, not oversold?
  - structure: British English, zero em-dashes, H2 structure, no AI-isms?

Returns: {passed, score, issues[], claims_to_verify[]}

Degradation: when the LLM is unavailable or returns malformed JSON, the
reviewer degrades to a neutral pass (score=5, no issues). It NEVER blocks
the pipeline on infrastructure failure. Blocking only happens on genuine
quality issues that the LLM surfaces.
