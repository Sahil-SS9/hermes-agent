"""Long-form ArticleDraft generator for X Articles.

Mirrors the educational-post path in llm_generate.build_educational_prompt
but emits a structured markdown article: title, lede, 3-5 H2 sections, a
"what I'd try next" takeaway, and a soft build-in-public sign-off. Length
target ~700-1200 words for deep_dive, ~500-800 for digest.

Reuses llm_generate._llm_configs() / _call_llm() / _load_voice_skill() /
gate_post() so the LLM chain and quality rules stay in one place. The
article-specific structure rules (>=3 H2, takeaway section) are
enforced by article_gates.check, not here.
