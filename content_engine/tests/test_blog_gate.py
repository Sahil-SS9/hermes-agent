"""Tests for blog.blog_gate — adhoc quality gate for manual/adhoc blog posts.

Covers:
  - article_gates.check integration (slop, em-dash (ASCII), length, secrets)
  - blog_reviewer.review integration (voice, accuracy, hype, structure)
  - Em-dash Unicode scan (U+2014, U+2013)

# Token-Maxing at the Edge

A counterintuitive claim grounded in concrete figures and real source material
that can be verified through the referenced papers and articles found at
https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12345 which covers the core mechanism.

## The mechanism

The numbers tell a story about how token-maxing works at the edge of the
distribution. When you push the context window to its limit, the model starts
to degrade in specific predictable ways. This is important for practitioners
who need to understand the trade-offs involved in long-context generation.
The research shows that performance drops measurably beyond 80 percent of
context.

## Worked example

Here is the code that illustrates the concept. The implementation uses a
simple sliding window approach that can be adapted to different model sizes
and context lengths. See https://example.com for more details on the approach.

""" + _PADDING + """

## What I'd try next

The takeaway is that you should always measure before you optimise. Start
with a baseline, then push the limits and observe where degradation begins.

# Building a Local Inference Server

A practical guide to running models locally without cloud dependencies.
This covers the setup, pitfalls, and real performance numbers from my own
experiments running llama.cpp on consumer hardware over the past month.

## The setup

I installed llama.cpp on my Ubuntu machine with an RTX 3090 and 64GB RAM.
The build process was straightforward but required some specific flags
to get optimal performance. I tested with models ranging from 7B to 70B
parameters and measured tokens per second at each tier.

## Reality check

The hype says local inference is easy. In practice, getting good throughput
requires careful tuning of context length, batch size, and thread count.
The reality is that most guides gloss over the hard parts.

## Takeaway

Start small, measure everything, and do not assume cloud-grade performance
on consumer hardware. The gap between expectations and reality is real.
