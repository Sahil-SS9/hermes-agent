"""Reply suggestion pipeline for X/Twitter.

Scans target accounts, identifies high-value posts to reply to, generates
thoughtful contextual replies, and queues them for approval.

The x-algorithm weights replies-with-author-interaction at ~150x — this is
the single highest-leverage activity for growth on X in 2026.
