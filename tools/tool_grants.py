"""Tool grant engine: single source of grant/revoke logic for the tool broker.

Mirrors ``tools.skill_grants`` exactly, but over tool names instead of skill
names. Used by the agent-facing ``tool_request`` tool, the runtime
toolset-scope fence (``agent.tool_executor``), and the kanban task-completion
hook. All grant state lives in the central append-only profile activity
ledger as ``tool.borrowed`` / ``tool.revoked`` events; this module is the only
place that interprets them.

A grant is temporary: it is revoked when its linked kanban task completes
(``revoke_grants_for_task``) or, for grants with no live task, after a TTL
(``sweep_expired_grants``).
