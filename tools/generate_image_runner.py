"""Shared in-process runner for the /generate-image feature.

Both the REPL (``hermes_cli.cli_commands_mixin``) and the gateway
(``gateway.slash_commands``) call this helper to execute one private
native-Codex image job.  It reuses the existing content-engine image
execution service — ``prepare_image_request`` → ``stage_and_plan_image_job``
→ ``execute_staged_image_job`` — without shelling out to
``content_engine.py`` and without duplicating generation logic.

The helper is deliberately synchronous: the content-engine service is
synchronous, and the gateway wraps the call in ``run_in_executor`` so it
never blocks the event loop.  A single ``run_generate_image`` entry point
keeps the two surfaces in sync and gives tests one seam to mock or to drive
with an injected ``NativeImageProvider``.

Importing the content-engine modules requires ``content_engine/`` on
``sys.path``; ``_ensure_content_engine_on_path`` handles that lazily on first
call so the CLI/gateway never pay the import cost until /generate-image runs.
